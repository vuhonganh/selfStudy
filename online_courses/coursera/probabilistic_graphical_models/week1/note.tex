This is the week 1 of the course Probabilistic Graphical Models (pgm) by Prof. Daphne Koller hosted on Coursera. The week 1 covers quite a lot of notions from distribution to Bayesian Network.

\section{Distribution}
A probability distribution function (aka PDF, probability density function, probability function, or density) is a function that indicates the probability that a given random variable will take on a particular value. If a random variable is discrete (i.e. the value of the random variable is contained in a countable set of values), then the probability density function, $f(x)$ of a random variable $X$ is: $f(x) = \mathbb{P}(X = x)$.\\

The multivariate form of a probability distribution function is the probability that a list of random variables will take on a list of values. If the random variables are discrete, the \textbf{joint probability density function}, $f(x_1, x_2, â€¦, x_n)$ for random variables $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ is defined by: 
\begin{align}
f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = P(X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2, \ldots, X_n=x_n)
\end{align}
